Listening to Lil Baby wid my Lil Baby so I guess she a vibe (bow)
I pray that I don't run out of time
Like Meek need a mill so I guess we're alike (whoosh)
To get bread in on the F ting but broski they keep ringing the line (bap)
I guess this is the life of crime
When it's wrong but it feels so right
